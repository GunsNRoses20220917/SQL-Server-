# SQL-Server- Case Statements.

In T-SQL scripting, we can use Case Statements to evaluate a condition and return one or more expression/results.

The Else Statement is Optional and executes when none of the WHEN Condition returns True.

For example:
we declare a variable @ProductID and assigned a specific value 1 for it.
In CASE Statement, we defined a condition and once the condition is True, its corresponding Value is returned.

Similarly, if we change the value of our variable to 4, then since there is no condition which is True for 4.
Hence it executes the Else Part.

We will see some codes to understand Case statements and few important SQL Queries to understand the concept.
